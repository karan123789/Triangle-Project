# Triangle-Project



This Python project is designed to determine the validity and type of a triangle based on user-inputted measurements. The program prompts the user to enter the lengths of three sides of a triangle. Using these measurements, it first checks whether the triangle is valid according to the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. If the triangle is valid, the program then identifies whether it is an equilateral triangle (all sides are equal), an isosceles triangle (two sides are equal), a scalene triangle (all sides are different), or a degenerate triangle (where the sum of the lengths of any two sides equals the length of the third side, resulting in a "flat" triangle).
